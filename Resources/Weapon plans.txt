//// PHOBOS ////
Fist - Pickaxe
* A slow, but hard-hitting melee weapon that gets slightly faster with Berserk, and hits WAY harder. Genuinely viable for fighting tougher foes like Arch-viles.

Chainsaw - ??? (Right now, Shield Saw & Jupiter Smasher)
* ??? (Right now, a faster-firing Beam Magnum with a blocking alt-fire... Not great.)

Pistol - Beam Magnum
* Infinite ammo pistol. About as weak as the original, with derandomized damage. Alt-fire for automatic pistol tap.

Shotgun - "Slayer's Companion" Riot Shotgun
* Auto-shotty with a bit of a kick to it. Drum-fed, 12 shots in the mag, reloads its whole mag at once. NO CASINGS, since the drum also covers the ejection port!!! Alt-fire for sticky bombs.

Super Shotgun - Quad Shotgun
* Four barrels. Primary fires all four, secondary fires just two at a time. Can reload each set of two individually.

Chaingun - Nailgun
* Fires nails from both barrels, alternating between them. Alt-fire for a burst shot with two ricocheting nails that deal extra damage.

Minigun - Super Nailgun
* Fires two nails at a time from each barrel. Quake's Super Nailgun... I guess. I'd like to change it at some point...

Rocket Launcher - ??? (Right now, Rocket Launcher)
* ??? (Right now, just a Rocket Launcher)

Grenade Launcher - ??? (Right now, Grenade Launcher)
* ??? (Right now, just a Grenade Launcher)

Plasma Rifle - ??? (Right now, Plasma Rifle)
* ??? (A slower, but slightly more powerful, plasma rifle that fires red plasma balls.)

Railgun - ??? (Right now, reskinned default railgun)
* ??? (Right now, reskinned default railgun)

BFG9000 - Plasma Repeater
* Like a big plasma chaingun that fires multi-colored plasma balls at a rapid pace. They can bounce off of floors and ceilings, just like the beta BFG.

BFG10K - ???
* ???
